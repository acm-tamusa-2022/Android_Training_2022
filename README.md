CodeRed 2022 Android Training

For this training, you'll create a wishlist app. The user will be able to enter a wish, and it should show up on the RecyclerView. Also, when the user leaves/closes the app, the data that was previously entered, should show up still.

I'll also go through installing android studio, android emulator, and sharing your project onto github. Once your done, please add your name and github repo url on the spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AmzbrihJE45bBpPhs6pIPj1deETuvjCNx14V0fWOLlI/edit?usp=sharing).
